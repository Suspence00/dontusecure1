                <h2>In-Depth Explanation with Potency Over Time</h2>
                <p>Let’s break down the potency over time and the speed of healing to see why <span class="cure2">Cure
                        2</span> is more effective:</p>

                <h3>Example Scenario: Potency Over Time</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="cure1">Cure 1</span>: Heals for 400 potency per cast. With a global cooldown (GCD)
                        of 2.5 seconds, you can cast <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> approximately 24 times in 60
                        seconds, resulting in 9600 potency over that time.</li>
                    <li><span class="cure2">Cure 2</span>: Heals for 700 potency per cast. With the same GCD of 2.5
                        seconds, you can cast <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> approximately 24 times in 60 seconds,
                        resulting in 16800 potency over that time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This means that by using <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span>, you’re getting an additional <strong>7200
                        potency</strong> over the same 60 seconds compared to <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span>. This is
                    a substantial increase in healing output, which can be crucial in high-stakes combat situations.</p>

                <h3>Example Scenario: Speed of Healing a Tank Under Heavy Damage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="cure1">Cure 1</span>: Heals for 400 potency every 2.5 seconds. If a tank is taking
                        rapid damage, you might need to cast <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> multiple times to
                        stabilize their HP. After 10 seconds (4 casts), you will have healed for 1600 potency.</li>
                    <li><span class="cure2">Cure 2</span>: Heals for 700 potency every 2.5 seconds. In the same 10
                        seconds (4 casts), <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> will have healed for 2800 potency.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In this scenario, <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> provides <strong>1200 additional potency</strong>
                    over just 10 seconds compared to <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span>. This faster and more effective
                    healing can be the difference between a tank surviving or falling during heavy damage phases.</p>

            <div id="freecure" class="tabcontent" style="display:none;">
                <h2>Why Relying on Freecure is a Trap</h2>
                <p><span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> has a 15% chance to trigger the <strong>Freecure</strong> effect,
                    making your next <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> free. While this might seem like a great way to
                    conserve MP, it’s actually a trap for several reasons:</p>

                <h3>The Freecure Trap</h3>
                <p><strong>Inconsistent Procs:</strong> The chance of triggering Freecure is only 15%. Statistically,
                    this means you can expect a Freecure proc roughly once every 6-7 casts of <span class="cure1">Cure
                        1</span>. Over 7 casts of <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> (at 2.5 seconds per cast), you'll
                    spend 17.5 seconds healing for 2800 potency, and you might get 1 free <span class="cure2">Cure
                        2</span> cast.</p>

                <h3>Potency Comparison:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>7x <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> + 1x <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span>
                            (Free):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Healing potency: 7x400 (Cure 1) + 700 (Cure 2) = 3500 potency</li>
                            <li>Global Cooldowns (GCD): <b>8 GCDs</b></li>
                            <li>MP cost: 7x400 = 2800 MP</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Using <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> only to achieve the same potency:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Healing potency: 5x700 = 3500 potency</li>
                            <li>Global Cooldowns (GCD): <b>5 GCDs</b></li>
                            <li>MP cost: 5x700 = 3500 MP</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>This comparison shows that using <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> only costs 25% more MP but
                    achieves the same amount of healing in 37.5% less time. In critical situations where healing
                    efficiency matters, time and GCD efficiency are much more crucial than MP efficiency.</p>

                <h3>Wasted Time and MP:</h3>
                <p>Every time you cast <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> hoping for a Freecure proc, you’re spending
                    more GCDs and potentially more MP on weaker heals, rather than directly providing stronger healing
                    with <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span>.</p>

                <p>In most situations, the guaranteed healing output of <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> far outweighs
                    the potential MP savings from Freecure. By focusing on <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> and using
                    <img src="48px-Lucid_Dreaming_Icon.png" alt="Lucid Dreaming Icon"> Lucid Dreaming effectively,
                    you’ll provide stronger and more reliable healing for your party.</p>

            <div id="mp-management" class="tabcontent" style="display:none;">
                <h2>But What About MP?</h2>
                <p>One concern might be the higher MP cost of <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> (1000 MP compared to
                    <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span>'s 400 MP). However, White Mages have access to <img
                        src="48px-Lucid_Dreaming_Icon.png" alt="Lucid Dreaming Icon"> <strong>Lucid Dreaming</strong>,
                    an ability that regenerates MP over time.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lucid Dreaming:</strong> Unlocked at level 14, this ability restores a significant
                        amount of MP over 21 seconds, allowing you to sustain your healing output without running out of
                        MP.</li>
                    <li>By using Lucid Dreaming effectively, you should <strong>never run out of MP</strong>. As a rule
                        of thumb, <b>pop Lucid Dreaming around 7000mp</b> for best practice MP management.</li>
                    <li>This makes the higher MP cost of <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> a non-issue.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><a href="#tabbed-content"><u>To Top</u></a></p>

            <div id="cast-recast-times" class="tabcontent" style="display:none;">
                <h2>Understanding Cast Time vs. Recast Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Even though <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> has a shorter cast time than <span class="cure2">Cure
                        2</span>, it’s important to understand the difference between cast time and recast time:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cast Time:</strong> This is the time it takes to cast the spell from the moment you
                        start casting until the spell is completed. <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> has a shorter cast
                        time of 1.5 seconds compared to <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span>, which has a cast time of 2
                        seconds. However, this isn't as important as...</li>
                    <li><strong>Recast Time (Global Cooldown or GCD):</strong> This is the time before you can use
                        another GCD after casting. Both <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> and <span
                            class="cure2">Cure 2</span> share the same recast time of 2.5 seconds, which means you
                        cannot cast another GCD until this time has elapsed, regardless of the cast time of
                        the individual spell.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> has a faster cast time, the recast time is the same as <span
                        class="cure2">Cure 2</span>. This means that even though <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span>
                    finishes casting quicker, you still have to wait the full 2.5 seconds before casting again.
                    Therefore, the total amount of healing you can output over time is significantly higher with <span
                        class="cure2">Cure 2</span> due to its higher potency, making it the superior choice.
