                <h2>In-Depth Explanation with Potency Over Time</h2>
                <p>Let’s break down the potency over a more realistic dungeon scenario to see why <span
                        class="cure2">Cure 2</span> is more effective:</p>

                <h3>Example Scenario: Healing a Tank During Dungeon Pulls</h3>
                <p>When tanking in a dungeon, a common scenario is the tank pulling multiple groups of enemies
                    Wall2Wall. During
                    these pulls, the tank takes steady damage and needs to be kept alive while also dealing damage:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="cure1">Cure 1</span>: Heals for 400 potency per cast. You might need to cast <span
                            class="cure1">Cure 1</span> multiple times to keep the tank's HP stable, spending more GCDs
                        on healing.</li>
                    <li><span class="cure2">Cure 2</span>: Heals for 700 potency per cast. With fewer casts needed to
                        stabilize the tank's HP, you have more time to cast offensive spells.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, if the tank takes damage that requires 1200 potency of healing to stabilize:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="cure1">Cure 1</span>: Requires three casts (7.5 seconds) to provide 1200 potency of
                        healing.</li>
                    <li><span class="cure2">Cure 2</span>: Requires only two casts (5 seconds) to provide 1400 potency
                        of healing, allowing you to switch back to dealing damage sooner.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By using <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span>, you can reduce the time spent healing and increase your
                    uptime on damage-dealing abilities, which is crucial in optimizing dungeon runs.</p>

                <h3>Example Scenario: Tanking a Dungeon Boss</h3>
                <p>In a dungeon boss fight, maintaining both tank and party member HP while also contributing to damage
                    is essential:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="cure1">Cure 1</span>: Heals for 400 potency per cast. To keep the tank's HP stable,
                        you might need to cast <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> repeatedly, reducing your opportunity
                        to deal damage.</li>
                    <li><span class="cure2">Cure 2</span>: Heals for 700 potency per cast. Fewer casts are needed to
                        stabilize the tank, allowing you to use the extra GCDs for damage spells like <span
                            class="damage-spell">Glare</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In a boss fight where every bit of damage counts, <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> provides more
                    efficient healing, enabling you to contribute more to the fight's overall DPS.</p>

                <p><a href="#tabbed-content"><u>To Top</u></a></p>
            </div>
            </div>

            <div id="freecure" class="tabcontent" style="display:none;">
                <h2>Why Relying on Freecure is a Trap</h2>
                <p><span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> has a 15% chance to trigger the <strong>Freecure</strong> effect,
                    making your next <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> free. While this might seem like a great way to
                    conserve MP, it’s actually a trap for several reasons:</p>

                <h3>Example Scenario: The Freecure Trap</h3>
                <p><strong>Inconsistent Procs:</strong> The chance of triggering Freecure is only 15%. Statistically,
                    this means you can expect a Freecure proc roughly once every 6-7 casts of <span class="cure1">Cure
                        1</span>. Over 7 casts of <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> (at 2.5 seconds per cast), you'll
                    spend 17.5 seconds healing for 2800 potency, and you might get 1 free <span class="cure2">Cure
                        2</span> cast.</p>

                <h3>Potency and Damage Output Comparison:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>7x <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> + 1x <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span>
                            (Free):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Healing potency: 7x400 (Cure 1) + 700 (Cure 2) = 3500 potency</li>
                            <li>Global Cooldowns (GCD): 8 GCDs</li>
                            <li>MP cost: 7x400 = 2800 MP</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Using <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> only to achieve the same potency:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Healing potency: 5x700 = 3500 potency</li>
                            <li>Global Cooldowns (GCD): 5 GCDs</li>
                            <li>MP cost: 5x1000 = 5000 MP</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>This comparison shows that using <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> only costs approximately 79% more
                    MP but achieves the same amount of healing in 37.5% less time. In critical situations where healing
                    efficiency matters, time and GCD efficiency are much more crucial than MP efficiency.</p>

                <h3>Impact on Damage Output:</h3>
                <p>Every time you cast <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> hoping for a Freecure proc, you’re spending
                    more GCDs on weaker heals instead of using those GCDs to contribute to your party's damage output.
                    The time you save by using <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> directly translates to more
                    opportunities to cast damage-dealing spells like <span class="damage-spell">Glare</span> or <span
                        class="damage-spell">Dia</span>.</p>

                <p>In most situations, the guaranteed healing output and time savings of <span class="cure2">Cure
                        2</span> far outweigh the potential MP savings from Freecure. By focusing on <span
                        class="cure2">Cure 2</span> and using <img src="48px-Lucid_Dreaming_Icon.png"
                        alt="Lucid Dreaming Icon"> Lucid Dreaming effectively, you’ll not only provide stronger and more
                    reliable healing for your party but also maximize your contribution to overall damage output.</p>

            <div id="mp-management" class="tabcontent" style="display:none;">
                <h2>But What About MP?</h2>
                <p>One concern might be the higher MP cost of <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> (1000 MP compared to
                    <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span>'s 400 MP). However, White Mages have access to <img
                        src="48px-Lucid_Dreaming_Icon.png" alt="Lucid Dreaming Icon"> <strong>Lucid Dreaming</strong>,
                    an ability that regenerates MP over time.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lucid Dreaming:</strong> Unlocked at level 14, this ability restores a significant
                        amount of MP over 21 seconds, allowing you to sustain your healing output without running out of
                        MP.</li>
                    <li>By using Lucid Dreaming effectively, you should <strong>never run out of MP</strong>. As a rule
                        of thumb, <b>pop Lucid Dreaming around 7000mp</b> for best practice MP management.</li>
                    <li>This makes the higher MP cost of <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span> a non-issue.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><a href="#tabbed-content"><u>To Top</u></a></p>
            </div>

            <div id="cast-recast-times" class="tabcontent" style="display:none;">
                <h2>Understanding Cast Time vs. Recast Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Even though <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> has a shorter cast time than <span class="cure2">Cure
                        2</span>, it’s important to understand the difference between cast time and recast time:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cast Time:</strong> This is the time it takes to cast the spell from the moment you
                        start casting until the spell is completed. <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> has a shorter cast
                        time of 1.5 seconds compared to <span class="cure2">Cure 2</span>, which has a cast time of 2
                        seconds. However, this isn't as important as...</li>
                    <li><strong>Recast Time (Global Cooldown or GCD):</strong> This is the time before you can use
                        another GCD after casting. Both <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> and <span class="cure2">Cure
                            2</span> share the same recast time of 2.5 seconds, which means you
                        cannot cast another GCD until this time has elapsed, regardless of the cast time of
                        the individual spell.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span> has a faster cast time, the recast time is the same as <span
                        class="cure2">Cure 2</span>. This means that even though <span class="cure1">Cure 1</span>
                    finishes casting quicker, you still have to wait the full 2.5 seconds before casting again.
                    Therefore, the total amount of healing you can output over time is significantly higher with <span
                        class="cure2">Cure 2</span> due to its higher potency, making it the superior choice.

                to
                compensate for healing and should rarely need to use Cure 2 at all.
                This is most relevant in late-ARR content where Cure 1 spam can lead to rocky Stone Vigils.
